# Hey, I'm Eric.

I'm a **web developer** and **YouTuber**. I try to make things like making websites and Linux simple enough for anyone to understand.

This website is meant to be my **"home base"** on the internet. I'll post some thoughts about things I'm interested in, whether it's about desktop Linux, building minimalistic websites, or books I'm currently reading.

If things look a little empty here, know that there is **more to come!**
