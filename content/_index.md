# Hi, I'm Eric Murphy.

I run a small [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@ericmurphyxyz) making videos about Linux and web development. I try to help the web become a better place by showing alternatives to using privacy-invading products and services like Google.

I'm also a freelance web developer, creating hand-crafted websites for small businesses that are fast and customer-friendly.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can email me at [eric@ericmurphy.xyz](mailto:eric@ericmurphy.xyz).
