It was a dark period in my life, and I don't like to remember it. But I used to be a weeaboo.

I don't take that word lightly. I wasn't your casual anime fan, the average viewer who watches *Attack on Titan* because it was trending on Netflix, the normie who thinks that "anime is pretty cool". I was a dyed-in-the-wool *otaku*.

I studied Japanese in high school in order to experience anime the way it was *meant to be experienced*! I have a *MyAnimeList* (which I will not reveal) of hundreds of titles that I've watched. To this day, some of my favorite bands and artists are Japanese just because I listened to so many *anison* and related music in my formative years. I'll admit that I can still enjoy a lot of the music.

That's my weeb résumé so I don't get accused of being a fake fan. Yep, I was as deep into anime as anyone else.

Eventually, I made the conscious decision to completely stop watching anime. But why would I give up something I loved? These days, it's very common to see people obsessing about their childhood passions well into adulthood, with various nerds and geeks from different fandoms collecting figurines, attending conventions, and unashamedly enjoying their medium of choice. These days, once you're in a fandom, you're in *for life*!

Well, except for me. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a grumpy diatribe against having fun. There's still a lot to appreciate in anime. To this day, *Spirited Away* is still my favorite film of all time and I can rewatch classic Ghibli movies time after time and get more out of them every time. There's no denying that there are anime series and movies that can rightly be called art.

But I've grown to realize that *most* anime is a net negative to one's life. In particular, I'm going to tell my story and the negative effects anime had in my life. It's more than a waste of time.

Because back when I was the most into anime, I was 22 years old, and I had basically become a anti-social, emotionally stunted shut-in. You know the cruel steretype of the typical anime nerd--but you also know, at least in part, that it rings true.

At first, it seems a bit like a chicken and egg problem. Is it just that socially-awkward teens tend to gravitate to anime, or does anime play a part in creating them? In this article, I'm going to argue that anime does play a negative role in creating the unhappy, asocial drop-out of society. I should know; I used to be one.
