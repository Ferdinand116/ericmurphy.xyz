Just finished setting up my new blog and website. I plan on doing a lot more writing as well as recording videos. Just making a lot more content about web development and Linux.

I wanted to set it up with Hugo, as before my website was using Gatsby, which I now think is complete overkill for a blog or any sort of simple content-based site. More about why I moved away from Gatsby in another post. I like Hugo because it turns everything into just HTML and CSS, no added bloated JavaScript that just slows the site down. It's a bit less fun than using React, but I think the road less JavaScript-ed is the right path for the web going forward, so that's what I'm trying to contribute to.

Also, it's set up on my own private VPS, which has already been a lot more educational than just having Netlify have it. It's nice to have my own server.
