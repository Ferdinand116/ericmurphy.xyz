I used to have a blog back in 2018 about web development. I ended up writing seven posts and even getting a decent amount of traction, but I ultimately stopped writing and decided to delete all the old posts from my website after I redesigned my site. Since then, I've put most of my effort into my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@ericmurphyxyz) instead.

It's been a while since I've thought about these long-forgotten posts, but I was recently inspired after reading a blog and finding content dating back years. (I don't remember which blog specifically inspired me, but I'll let you know if I remember.) With it, there was a notice saying that the old posts are kept up to show how the author's writing has progressed over the years. Even though the old posts were outdated, filled with old ideas the author doesn't necessarily agree with anymore, and filled with amateurish writing, they were all there.

With this in mind, I've decided to bring back my old posts in a page titled **[The Vault](/vault)**. These posts aren't up to my current quality standards, so I'm not putting them under the main blog, but they're there if you want to travel back in time and see my old writing.

Let it be known that **I certainly do not reccommend reading these**--I no longer believe some of the same things I did when I wrote them, the writing is terrible, and they're filled with curse words (which I thought was really cool and gave a level of authenticity back then). But for archival reasons, I'm putting them back up on the website. Maybe you'll find some entertainment from them, or at least see how my writing has changed over the years (hopefully for the better).
