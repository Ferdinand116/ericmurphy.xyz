title: Links

Here are some links to where you can find me online. I've also included links to other websites that I find useful or interesting. Since search engines tend to only rank the most popular sites with few exceptions, finding interesting small websites is increasingly difficult. Obviously, linking a website here does not constitute an endorsement of everything they've ever posted.

## My Links

- [My GitHub](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz) - Here you can find my dotfiles and various scripts I've written.

## Blogs I Like to Read

- [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/) - Blog of a YouTuber that writes about Linux, software, and philosophy.
- [Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/) - Thoughts about FOSS from the founder of sourcehut.
- [Open Source Musings](https://opensourcemusings.com/) - A blog about Linux and open source.
- [Tynan](https://tynan.com) - Lifestyle blog with some interesting thoughts. He does yearly "gear review" posts where you can find a lot of good-quality equipment recommendations, especially if you want to live more minimally or travel.

## Interesting Websites
- [Spyware Watchdog](https://spyware.neocities.org/) - Reviews for popular software and services based on how privacy-respecting they are (with no compromise).

## YouTube Channels Worth Watching
- [Luke Smith](https://www.youtube.com/lukesmithxyz) - Videos about free and open source technology, Linux, and general philosophy.
- [Louis Rossmann](https://www.youtube.com/user/rossmanngroup) - Videos about repairability, privacy, and interesting rants on various topics, tech and otherwise.
- [Mental Outlaw](https://www.youtube.com/c/MentalOutlaw) - Mostly tech news that leans toward being entertaining. Still, you can learn something as well.
- [Brodie Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/c/BrodieRobertson) - Linux channel that posts nearly every day. Sometimes a little bit too much quantity over quality, but there's lots of great content if you sift through the channel a bit.
- [Trafotin](https://www.youtube.com/c/Trafotin) - Channel about FOSS, privacy, and other interesting tech-related topics. Also a Vtuber, but at least it's not a girl so people can't simp over him.
- [Natural Hypertrophy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG-3rEW4IrDNa7-9iGByc2A) - Fitness channel about lifting, bodybuilding, and masculinity-focused philosophy.
- [Alan Thrall](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlanThrall) - Fitness channel focusing on powerlifting, and more recently, general health and fitness. Some of the best "how to" videos for movements like the squat and deadlift if you're new to lifting.
