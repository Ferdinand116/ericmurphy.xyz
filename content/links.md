title: Links

Here are some links to other websites that I find useful or interesting. Since search engines tend to only rank the most popular sites with few exceptions, [finding interesting small websites is increasingly difficult](/blog/discoverability/). This is my way of helping to correct that.

## YouTube Channels

I purposefully don't watch much YouTube anymore, because I find it very hard to responsibly use the website without being affected by the algorithm. The few channels I still subscribe to, I do so via RSS.
