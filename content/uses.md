title: Uses
---

Here's a list of all the software, technologies, and hardware I use on a daily basis. Links to paid services/products are affiliate links.

## This Website

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - A static site generator that just outputs HTML and CSS instead of a bloated mess of JavaScript or MySQL databases that is complete overkill for most websites.
- [Umami Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x8w9igz7Ew) - Self-hosted, privacy-respecting web analytics.
- [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9005580-8H) - My preferred VPS provider. I use a cheap Debian server to host all my projects. Having your own VPS gives you a lot more freedom in hosting your own website.

## Software I Use

- zsh - A shell with a few more features than bash that makes it nicer to use.
- [(neo)vim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c68MkeMBjhE&t) - My preferred text editor. Vim notoriously takes time to learn, but is much less scary than people make it out to be and definitely worth the learning curve.
- [VSCodium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_eFYsuV1PU) - My preferred code editor for when I'm working on larger projects. VSCodium is VS Code, just without the Microsoft telemetry.
- Firefox - As much as I don't like Mozilla, FireFox is my current favorite web browser all things considered. I've removed a lot of Mozilla junk (Pocket, telemetry, etc.) with a custom user.js file based on the [arkenfox user.js](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/).
- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) - My email client. Not my favorite application ever, but the best that exists.
- [Alacritty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76GbxnD8wnM) - Simple and fast terminal emulator with sensible defaults.
- [Rofi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TutfIwxSE_s) - A nice application launcher.
- [lf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oWqD3JCXuI) - My favorite terminal file manager. Simple, fast, and very configurable.
- [vimwiki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbF0yAghbDo) - Note-taking plugin for Vim. This is where I write all my notes.

## Desk Setup

- [HP Spectre x360](https://amzn.to/3G0pTbZ) - My laptop that I use for everyday work. It's not the best laptop. The touchscreen and the 2-in-1 tablet gimmick is a total meme. I wouldn't recommend buying it, but it's not that bad.
- [Roost Laptop Stand](https://amzn.to/3qX7sP7) - Great portable, foldable laptop stand for when I want to work outside.
- [Samson Technologies Q2U Microphone](https://amzn.to/3F22Egd) - A cheap microphone with decent quality.

## How'd you make your desktop look so cool?

- [Arch Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsNLZwuUJLU) - Still my favorite Linux distribution. It's very easy to use once you get over the initial hurdle of installing it and doing some configuration. The investment is definitely worth your time.
- [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) - My favorite window manager.
- [Polybar](https://polybar.github.io/) - Status bar at the top.
- [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) - Window transparency and background blur. Purely for aesthetics.
- [Powerlevel10k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXKhv2rXLBo) - Zsh prompt to make my terminal look nice.
- [Tokyo Night](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=enkia.tokyo-night) - The color scheme I use for everything. Started as a VS Code theme, but you can find it as a theme for almost anything. In some older videos, I use the colors from Monokai Pro (Spectrum).

## Fonts

- [JetBrains Mono Nerd Font](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_FSqS4C1Ns) - A nice programming font with Nerd Font icons (of course). Previously I used Fira Code.
