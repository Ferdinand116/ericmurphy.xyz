      <description>Just finished setting up my new blog and website. I plan on doing a lot more writing as well as recording videos. Just making a lot more content about web development and Linux.
I wanted to set it up with Hugo, as before my website was using Gatsby, which I now think is complete overkill for a blog or any sort of simple content-based site. More about why I moved away from Gatsby in another post.</description>
